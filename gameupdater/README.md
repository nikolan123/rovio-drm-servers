# Scripts for game updates

These scripts allow you to publish a exe (Possibly other files too) to the game and make it detect a update

Configuring hosts file:

In your OSs hosts file add the line
`127.0.0.1 cloud.rovio.com` (only replace 127.0.0.1 with the ip of the computer hosting the server.py file if it isnt the same computer as your going to play the game on)
